# Financial Benchmarking Platform for Single-Campus Senior Living Organizations

## 1. Executive Summary

This project aims to address a critical market intelligence gap by developing a specialized financial benchmarking database and analytics platform for single-campus (standalone) senior living organizations. By manually extracting and curating key financial data from publicly available IRS Form 990s, we are building a proprietary dataset that allows these unique organizations to accurately compare their performance against a true peer group. The initial phase involves manual data entry to create a proof-of-concept, with a long-term vision of automating data extraction and offering a subscription-based service. The immediate goal is to present a functional demo of the core concept using a sample dataset.

## 2. The Problem Statement

In the nonprofit senior living sector, performance benchmarking is a crucial tool for strategic planning, operational efficiency, and governance. However, a significant portion of the market—standalone, single-campus life plan communities—lacks access to relevant comparative data.

**Lack of Relevant Peers**: Most available industry reports, like the Ziegler 100, focus on the largest multi-site organizations. Comparing a single-campus entity to these large systems is an "apples-to-oranges" comparison that yields misleading insights.

**Internal Data Silos**: In the absence of external benchmarks, many organizations are forced to rely solely on their own historical data (year-over-year performance), which fails to account for broader market trends and competitive positioning.

**Strategic Disadvantage**: This information gap puts standalone communities at a strategic disadvantage in making key decisions regarding financial management, executive compensation, and resource allocation.

## 3. The Proposed Solution

We propose the creation of a centralized, searchable, and filterable database that provides high-value benchmarking insights specifically for single-campus senior living organizations.

**Core Functionality**: The platform will allow users to analyze aggregated performance data from a curated list of peer organizations.

**Data Source**: The foundation of this platform is data meticulously extracted from IRS Form 990s, the annual financial return filed by nonprofit organizations.

**Value Proposition**: We will provide actionable intelligence that empowers leadership teams and boards of directors to make data-driven decisions, assess their organization's health, and identify areas for improvement.

## 4. Methodology and Phased Approach

The project is structured in a phased approach to manage complexity and validate assumptions at each stage.

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Current Phase)

**Process**: Manual data entry from Form 990 PDFs to build an initial, high-quality dataset.

**Focus**: Compiling a sample of 100-200 standalone organizations to create a meaningful peer group.

**Outcome**: A functional database prototype that demonstrates the core value of the concept.

### Phase 2: Automation and Scalability (Future Vision)

**Process**: Explore and implement automated data extraction methods. This could involve parsing the XML files of 990s available from the IRS or utilizing advanced OCR technology.

**Data Management**: Use the Employer Identification Number (EIN) as a unique identifier for each organization to build a robust system for annual data updates.

**Outcome**: A scalable data pipeline that significantly reduces manual labor and allows for the rapid expansion of the database.

### Phase 3: Platform Development and Monetization

**Process**: Develop a user-friendly, web-based front-end for the database.

**Features**: Include dashboards for trend analysis (creating "panel data" to track performance over time), customizable peer group selection, and report generation.

**Business Model**: Launch a subscription-based service, offering annual access to the benchmarking platform and its insights.

## 5. Key Data Points & Analytics

The database will focus on the most critical financial and operational metrics from the Form 990, including:

**Part I (Summary)**: Key financial activities and overview.

**Revenue & Expenses**: Program service revenue, contributions, total revenue, total expenses, and net income.

**Balance Sheet**: Total assets, liabilities, and net assets.

**Compensation**: Data for key executives and highest-compensated employees.

## 6. Current Status & Next Steps

The project is actively in Phase 1.

**Progress**: The methodology for manual data entry has been defined.

**Immediate Action**: A sample data file is currently being compiled to build a working demo.

**Upcoming Milestone**: A project demonstration is scheduled for this coming Friday to showcase the prototype's functionality to key stakeholders and validate the project's direction.
